# üëã Meet Declarative YAML
Declarative YAML (dYAML) is a declarative way to create and load yaml config files.
Originally build for [RustyConnector](https://github.com/Aelysium-Group/rustyconnector-core),
dYAML dynamically reads the members of the declared config class in order to infer details such as type, name, and more!

Configs are functional and can generate/parse perfectly fine.
They just have awkward formatting and weird whitespace at times.
